template.name: "Secure Kubernetes toolchain"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, and deploy an application securely into a Kubernetes cluster managed by the IBM Bluemix Container Service. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own GitHub repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/06/docker-container-security-with-vulnerability-advisor/), source control, issue tracking, and online editing.\n\n **First-time IBM Bluemix Containers Service users**: Make sure that your container image registry is correctly set up with a [namespace](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/index.html). IMPORTANT NOTE: For the pipeline to build containers successfully, please use these steps to define your namespace:\n- bx login\n- bx target --cf\n- bx cr namespace-add <my_namespace>\n\nYou can manage your Bluemix Container clusters in the [console](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_cluster.html#cs_cluster).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tc_secure_kube?task=2) for this toolchain."
